# Healthcare Dataset Anonymization Configuration
# Optimized for medical records with HIPAA compliance considerations

overrides:
  # Patient names - use pseudonymization (reversible) or hash (irreversible)
  - column: Name
    detector_hint: name
    technique: pseudonym
    params:
      mode: name
      locale: en_US
  
  # Doctor names - also sensitive, use pseudonym
  - column: Doctor
    detector_hint: name
    technique: pseudonym
    params:
      mode: name
      locale: en_US
  
  # Dates - generalize to preserve temporal patterns while hiding exact dates
  - column: Date of Admission
    detector_hint: dob
    technique: generalize  # still aggregated for privacy in both modes
    params:
      granularity: month  # Shows year-month only
  
  - column: Discharge Date
    detector_hint: dob
    technique: generalize
    params:
      granularity: month
  
  # Billing Amount - add noise for differential privacy (preserves statistical properties)
  - column: Billing Amount
    detector_hint: salary
    # For irreversible anonymization we rely on the pipeline's
    # salary rule (shuffle) which preserves the distribution.
    # This explicit override keeps the label but defers the
    # concrete technique choice to the mode (reversible/irreversible).
    technique: shuffle
  
  # Room Number - tokenize to preserve relationships while anonymizing
  - column: Room Number
    detector_hint: numeric_id
    technique: tokenize
  
  # Age - can be generalized or kept as-is (already somewhat anonymized)
  # Leaving Age as-is since it's already aggregated data
  # If needed, uncomment below:
  # - column: Age
  #   detector_hint: dob
  #   technique: generalize
  #   params:
  #     bucket_size: 10  # Group into 10-year ranges

# Columns that are safe to keep as-is (categorical medical data)
allowlist:
  # These are already anonymized categorical values
  # Gender, Blood Type, Medical Condition, etc. can be shuffled if needed
  # but are generally safe for sharing

default_strategy:
  reversible: pseudonym
  irreversible: hash
